# myScriptCollection

This repository contains a collection of useful scripts that I use on my system. 
Everyone is welcome to come and take anything you like. 
Some may not be even anything complex, but just commands shorteners and small QoL improvements :) 

Follow the steps below to install and use these scripts.


## Installation


# Clone this repository to the location of your choice
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Egonef/myScriptCollection.git
```
# Navigate to the repository directory
```bash
cd myScriptCollection
```
# Grant execution permissions to the installation script
```bash
chmod +x installscript.sh
```
# Run the installation script to copy the scripts to the 'scripts' folder and give them execution permissions.
# By default, the scripts will be placed in the '/bin' directory, which is usually included in the system's $PATH.
# If you want to change the installation location, you can modify the 'carpeta_destino' variable in the installation script:
```bash
./installscript.sh
```
